### Usage:

 Generate your workflow repo from this repository, and generate workflow file from `template.yaml`. You can rename the copy of `template.yaml` to any name you want, but remember that the file extension must be `.yaml` or `.yml`. 

In your workflow file, modify the content according to the annotations. 
Then you can startup the workflow manually or regularly. 
+ Select the workflow name on the Actions page to run it manually.
+ For run regularly, you need to uncomment:
```
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 */18 * * *
``` 

Each time this workflow runs, it will check whether the specified repository is updated. If the source code is updated, it will start compiling the new firmware.

Whether the workflow is started manually or regularly, the compilation will only be triggered when the source code is updated. However, during manual startup, you can force firmware compilation by entering `true` in `Build new firmware anyway`.
